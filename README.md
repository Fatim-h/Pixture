A pixel art plaform. Allows you to make and save pixelated art.

For the Design: there is currently no design, display is underwork.

*CAUTION: There is a different limit for pixel dimesions for different screens. I have not calculated what it is yet, so if you are using on mobile: 50* * *50* *laptop/PC:* *100* * *100*. *If you exceed this limit website will crash =D*
